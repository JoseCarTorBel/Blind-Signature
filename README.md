# Blind Signature algorithm with RSA
Chaum's RSA blind signature scheme. Project is doing for Security Computing subject.

## Code

We used Java 8, and we applied Sockets to simulate server - client scheme. 

## Usage

1. Run server.
2. Run client.

## Blind signature with stadistics
The alternative to using multiple signature keys is to use a statistical protocol, whereby the signer can "acceptably" verify the structure of the document they are signing. 

The protocol is as follows. We seek that the signed document has a certain structure and only a random component without meaning can vary, but that is what gives it its uniqueness.
